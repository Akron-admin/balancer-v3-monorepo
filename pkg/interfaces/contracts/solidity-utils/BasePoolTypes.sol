 * because the underlying stETH token is rebasing, and such tokens are unsupported by the Vault. They may also be
 * tokens like sEUR, which track an underlying asset, but are not yield-bearing. Finally, this encompasses
 * yield-bearing ERC4626 tokens, which can be used to facilitate swaps without requiring wrapping or unwrapping
 * in most cases. The `paysYieldFees` flag can be used to indicate whether a token is yield-bearing (e.g., waDAI),
 * not yield-bearing (e.g., sEUR), or yield-bearing but exempt from fees (e.g., in certain nested pools, where
 * yield fees are charged elsewhere).
 *
 * NB: STANDARD must always be the first enum element, so that newly initialized data structures default to Standard.
